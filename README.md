# $\mathbb{MSF}$ Capstone
 
Welcome to the $\mathbb{MSF}$ capstone! This year we will use GitHub classrooms to manage our projects throughout the term. In this repository, A sample notebook (initially written by the CVXPY group and modified) has been included to: (i) get us started and (ii) review some concepts from portfolio optimization. 

We have a file called models.py that includes all our classes for our models and a file called data_utils.py, which includes all the functions used to get data. This repo is just one way to set up our project.

Why are we using GitHub classrooms? Here are three reasons why we are using it:
* Industry and academia make extensive use of GitHub to share work amongst peers and collaborators
* It forces us to break the project down into components that can be easily understood by others, resulting in better code
* It allows for easy tracking of progress and contributions of team members

## Next Steps:
* Download GitHub desktop
* Go through the getting started assignment: Git and Github Fundamentals
* Push/pull/branch/commit/etc in this repository

## Note:
* !git clone will be run on each group's repository at the end of the term 
* The readme should include any dependencies and instructions to run the code
