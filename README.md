# $\mathbb{MSF}$ Capstone
 
Welcome to the $\mathbb{MSF}$ capstone! This year we will use GitHub classrooms to manage our projects throughout the term. In this repository, I have included a notebook written by the CVXPY group to get us started and review some concepts from portfolio optimization. 

Why are we using GitHub classrooms? Here are three reasons why we are using it:
* To avoid a learning curve in industry
* It forces us to break the project down into components that can be easily understood by others, resulting in better code
* It allows progress to be tracked with ease

## Next Steps:
* Download GitHub desktop
* Go through the getting started assignment: Git and Github Fundamentals if you have not already.
