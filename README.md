# $\mathbb{MSF}$ Capstone
 
Welcome to the $\mathbb{MSF}$ capstone! This year we will use GitHub classrooms to manage our projects throughout the term. In this repository, I have included a notebook initially written by the CVXPY group and modified by me to get us started and review some concepts from portfolio optimization. 

We have a file called models.py that includes all our classes for our models and a file called data_utils.py, which includes all the functions used to get data. This repo is just one way to set up our project.

Why are we using GitHub classrooms? Here are three reasons why we are using it:
* After EngSci, I experienced a learning curve when using GitHub in industry. I wouldn't say I liked it, but it seems like it is the best way to work with others on code
* It forces us to break the project down into components that can be easily understood by others, resulting in better code
* It allows progress and contributions of team members to be tracked with ease

## Next Steps:
* Download GitHub desktop
* Go through the getting started assignment: Git and Github Fundamentals
