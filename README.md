# $\mathbb{MSF}$ Capstone
 
Welcome to the $\mathbb{MSF}$ capstone! This year we will use GitHub classrooms to manage our projects throughout the term. In this repository, I have included a notebook written by the CVXPY group to get us started and review some concepts from portfolio optimization. 

Why are we using GitHub classrooms? Here are three reasons why we are using it:
* To avoid a learning curve in industry
* It forces us to break the project down into components that can be easily understood by others, resulting in better code
* It allows for easy tracking of progress and contributions of team members

## Next Steps:
* Download GitHub desktop
* Go through the getting started assignment: Git and Github Fundamentals if you have not already.
## Info
* This repo is where your entire project should live. Ideally, one should be able to install any dependencies listed in your README, clone the repo and then run the code.
* To run the portfolio optimization notebook, install cvxpy, matplotlib, scipy, numpy
